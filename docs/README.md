# Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Somnia Governance Engine - a modular, production-ready governance toolkit for blockchain ecosystems.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is Somnia Governance Engine?

The Somnia Governance Engine is a complete governance solution that enables projects to:

* **Create and manage governance proposals** with timelock execution
* **Implement token-based voting** with proper delegation and snapshot mechanics
* **Run simple voting sessions** for community decisions
* **Integrate governance functionality** into existing Rust applications
* **Deploy secure contracts** with built-in anti-spam and security measures

## ðŸ§© Modular Architecture

The engine is designed as a **modular toolkit** where you can use any combination of components:

### Smart Contracts (Optional)

* **Use Ours**: Production-ready governance contracts
* **Use Yours**: Point our Rust engine to your existing contracts
* **Use None**: Pure off-chain governance with cryptographic signatures

### Storage Layer (Optional)

* **PostgreSQL**: Full-featured database with our schema
* **Your Database**: Use existing database with custom adapters
* **File Storage**: Simple file-based persistence
* **In-Memory**: No persistence, great for testing

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Choose your integration approach:

### Minimal Setup (Pure Rust)

```bash
# Just add to your Cargo.toml - no other dependencies needed
cargo add somnia-governance-engine
```

### With Smart Contracts

```bash
# Requires Node.js + Foundry for contract deployment
git clone https://github.com/your-org/somnia-governance-engine.git
cd contracts && forge build
```

### With Database Persistence

```bash
# Requires PostgreSQL
createdb governance_db
# Configure DATABASE_URL in .env
```
